# Testing

How tests are organised, what they cover, and what to add when you introduce
a new public API.

## Two layers

1. **Unit tests** live alongside the code they test, inside a
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block at the bottom of the same file.
2. **Doc-tests** live in the `///` rustdoc comments above public items.

Both run under `cargo test`. There is intentionally no `tests/` integration
directory — the examples under [`examples/`](../examples/) play that role
because each one is a complete program that exercises the public API.

## The actual / expect pattern

Every assertion follows the same skeleton:

```rust
let actual = ...;
let expect = ...;
assert_eq!(actual, expect);
```

Reasons:

- `actual` and `expect` make the role of each side obvious without re-reading
  the assertion macro arguments.
- `assert_eq!` error messages then read naturally: `assertion `actual ==
  expect` failed`.
- The pattern survives refactoring: rename one side, the other is unaffected.

## When you add a new public API

You must add **both**:

1. A **unit test** in the appropriate `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block.
2. A **doc-test** in the `///` comment above the item.

The doc-test serves two purposes — it tests the example *and* it ensures the
example in the rendered docs compiles.

## What to test

- Happy path: typical input, expected output.
- Edge cases: `[0; 10]`, `[9; 10]`, every boundary of the testable range.
- Error cases for parsers: wrong length, wrong separator, doubled spaces,
  leading/trailing whitespace, non-digit characters. See
  [`src/from_str.rs`](../src/from_str.rs) for the existing pattern.
- Round-trips: `parse → display → parse` must recover the original value.
- Equivalence: every free function must match its `NHSNumber` method
  counterpart on identical input.

## Examples are tests too

Every file under [`examples/`](../examples/) ends with `assert_eq!` /
`assert!` checks (or, when output is the point, an explicit "ok" print plus
asserts on the accumulated state). A successful run leaves a clear trace.

Running examples is part of release sign-off (see
[`release.md`](release.md)).

## Running the suite

```sh
cargo test                        # All unit and doc-tests.
cargo test -- --nocapture         # Show `println!` from inside tests.
cargo test --doc                  # Just the doc-tests.
cargo test <pattern>              # Only tests whose name matches.

cargo run --example basic_usage   # Run a single example.
cargo build --examples            # Compile every example without running.
```

If you add an example, it must compile and run end-to-end before the change
lands.

## What is *not* tested here

- Real patient data — never. See [`safety.md`](safety.md).
- Compliance against external NHS systems — the crate models the format and
  algorithm; integration testing is the deploying organisation's job.

## Performance tests

There is no benchmark suite. The hot paths are trivially fast (ten `i8`
multiplies); add one only if a real workload demonstrates a regression.
